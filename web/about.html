		<h1>About</h1>

		<p>
			Hello, my name is Ty. I am 28 years old and I was born in St.Maries Idaho. I did not live there for long as my parents quickly moved to Logan Utah, where I stayed until I was 25. I have always been fascinated by computers as I have always had a love for video games. Since I was young, I have been fairly tech-savvy (moreso than most of my family at least). I remember when I was younger hearing that I should do some type of work on a computer.
		</p>

			<p>While my parents were right about that, I did not listen. Instead, I worked odd jobs and moreso lived for the weekend. </p>

			<p>As I got older, I found a love for health and fitness. This sparked something inside of me as I saw progress with my physical body and how I felt overall. Once I started to see progress physically, I decided that I didnt just want to be a meat-head. I wanted to be an intellectual. I wanted to be successful.</p> 

			<p>As mentioned above, despite listening to my parents and getting into the tech industry, I worked in the auto industry and in sales. While I found success, money and friends, I was not happy with myself or my life.</p>

			<p>I got into coding about a year ago now, and I truly love it. I look forward to becoming a successful Software Engineer.</p>
